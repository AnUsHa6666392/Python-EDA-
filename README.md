I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on multiple real-world datasets to extract insights, identify patterns, and prepare the data for machine learning and decision-making. Each project follows a structured EDA workflow including data cleaning, visualization, feature understanding, and key observations.

Datasets and Analysis Focus:

Ames Housing: Analyzed housing features and prices to understand the factors influencing home values.

Netflix Titles: Explored the types, release years, genres, and countries of shows/movies available on Netflix.

Car Crashes: Investigated traffic accident data to find trends in crash severity, causes, and location-based insights.

Heart Attack Prediction (India): Studied Indian patient health records to find key indicators linked to heart disease risk.

Hotel Bookings: Analyzed booking patterns, cancellations, and guest behaviors to reveal trends in hotel performance.

Social Media Usage: Explored user activity across platforms to identify usage patterns by age, gender, and device.
